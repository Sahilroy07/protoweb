   	 	<button id="but">Friends</button>

		<p id="first">I have many friends, school friends, college friends, tution friends
		but I hangout with just a few ones i.e with 7 of my school friends only.
		so now I am going to introduce to that few friends who kinda helped me 
		during my project website making.</p>

		<p id="second">ABHISHEK BHATTA</p>
		<p id="third">We both were classmates since our nursery and we 
		ended our school life together at the same section also. He is 
		very supportive and funny he is very good listner and has a good 
		taste in tech.That's not it our friendship was not ended at school
		it began a new phase at our college where we both are currently
		studying at. He was the one who gave me the option to join ITER 
		otherwise I was searching for a govt. college. We both love computer and 
		codes. He till this day is very close to me and I like to share my stories 
		with him.<br>
		</p>

		<p id="fourth">SAI NARAYAN PANDA</p>
		<p id="fifth">He is anothe school friend whom I met at a tution when I was studying
		in class 6<sup>th</sup>. we became very good friends in tution and later started hanging
		out at school during lunch hours. He was also with me till the end of school life and was
		with me in my section from 9<sup>th</sup> onwards. Luckily he ended up at the very same
		college where me and bhatta are studying...I feel like a magnet and these people are
		not going to leave me in my future also. He is also caring and kind but rather than 
		wasting braincells in books and codes he wastes it in god only knows where. But 
		after all he is a valuable friend who doesn't need any verification from social media.<br>
